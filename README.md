# 📊 Social Media Popularity Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the popularity level of social media users based on structured profile data—excluding direct engagement metrics like likes or shares.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on estimating a user's popularity by analyzing features such as:
- Bio content
- Follower count
- Posting frequency

By avoiding engagement data (likes, shares), the model aims to make unbiased predictions using profile characteristics alone.

## ✅ Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from raw profile data
- Implementation of classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Achieved 85% accuracy using only structured profile attributes
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📈 Results

- Final model achieved **85% accuracy**
- Demonstrated that structured profile data alone can provide reliable popularity predictions

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Include NLP for deeper bio analysis
- Deploy as a web app for interactive predictions
- Expand dataset to include cross-platform profiles
